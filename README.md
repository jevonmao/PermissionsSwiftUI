## About
`PermissionsSwiftUI` is a SwiftUI API to ask for user permissions using Swift. The user will be presented a modal to handle permissions.

The UI/UX is highly customizable and resembles an **Apple style**.

## Quickstart
To use PermissionsSwiftUI, simply add the `JMPermission` modifier to any view. <br />
Pass in a `Binding<Bool>` to show the modal view, and add whatever permissions you want to show.
```Swift
   struct ContentView: View {
       @State var showModal = false
       
       var body: some View {
           Button(action: {
               showModal=true
           }, label: {
               Text("Ask user for permissions")
           })
           .JMPermissions(showModal: $showModal, for: [.locationAlways, .photo, .microphone])
       }
   }
 ```
